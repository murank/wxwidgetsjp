<H2>wxGTK port</H2>
<P>

wxGTK is a port of wxWidgets using the GTK+ library.
It makes use of GTK+'s native widgets wherever possible and uses
wxWidgets' generic controls when needed. GTK+ itself has been
ported to a number of systems, but so far only the original X11
version is supported. Support for other GTK+ backends is planned,
such as the new DirectFB backend.<P>

All work is being done on GTK+ version 2.0 and above. Support for
GTK+ 1.2 will be deprecated in a later release.<P>

You will need GTK+ 2.0 or higher which is available from:<P>
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</A><P>

The newer version of GTK+ you use, the more native widgets and
features will be utilized. We have gone to a great extent to
allow compiling wxWidgets applications with a latest version of
GTK+, with the resulting binary working on systems even with a
much lower version of GTK+. You will have to ensure that the
application is launched with lazy symbol binding for that.<P>

In order to configure wxWidgets to compile wxGTK you will 
need use the <TT>--with-gtk</TT> argument to the <TT>configure</TT> script.
This is the default for many systems.<P>

GTK+ 1.2 can still be used, albeit discouraged. For that you can
pass <TT>--with-gtk=1</TT> to the <TT>configure</TT> script.<P>

For further information, please see the files in docs/gtk
in the distribution.<P>
