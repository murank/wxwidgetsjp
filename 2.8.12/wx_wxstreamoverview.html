Standard C++ streams can cause problems on several platforms:
they work quite well in most cases, but in the multi-threaded case, for example,
they have many problems. Some Borland compilers refuse to work at all
with them and using iostreams on Linux makes writing programs that are
binary compatible across different Linux distributions, impossible.<P>

Therefore, wxStreams have been added to wxWidgets so that applications can
reliably compile and run on all supported platforms without dependence on a
particular release of libg++.<P>

wxStreams is divided in two main parts:<P>
<OL>

<LI>  the core: wxStreamBase, wxStreamBuffer, wxInputStream, wxOutputStream,
wxFilterIn/OutputStream

</LI><LI>  the "IO" classes: wxSocketIn/OutputStream, wxDataIn/OutputStream, wxFileIn/OutputStream, ...

</LI></OL>
<P>

wxStreamBase is the base definition of a stream. It defines, for example,
the API of OnSysRead, OnSysWrite, OnSysSeek and OnSysTell. These functions 
are really implemented by the "IO" classes.
wxInputStream and wxOutputStream inherit from it.<P>

wxStreamBuffer is a cache manager for wxStreamBase: it manages a stream buffer
linked to a stream. One stream can have multiple stream buffers  but one stream
have always one autoinitialized stream buffer.<P>

wxInputStream is the base class for read-only streams. It implements Read,
SeekI (I for Input), and all read or IO generic related functions.
wxOutputStream does the same thing but it is for write-only streams.<P>

wxFilterIn/OutputStream is the base class definition for stream filtering.
Stream filtering means a stream which does no syscall but filters data
which are passed to it and then pass them to another stream.
For example, wxZLibInputStream is an inline stream decompressor.<P>

The "IO" classes implements the specific parts of the stream. This could be
nothing in the case of wxMemoryIn/OutputStream which bases itself on
wxStreamBuffer. This could also be a simple link to the a true syscall
(for example read(...), write(...)).<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Generic usage: an example</FONT></B><P>

Usage is simple. We can take the example of wxFileInputStream and here is some sample
code:<P>
<PRE>
 ...
 // The constructor initializes the stream buffer and open the file descriptor
 // associated to the name of the file.
 wxFileInputStream in_stream("the_file_to_be_read");

 // Ok, read some bytes ... nb_datas is expressed in bytes.
 in_stream.Read(data, nb_datas);
 if (in_stream.LastError() != wxSTREAM_NOERROR) {
   // Oh oh, something bad happens.
   // For a complete list, look into the documentation at wxStreamBase.
 }

 // You can also inline all like this.
 if (in_stream.Read(data, nb_datas).LastError() != wxSTREAM_NOERROR) {
   // Do something.
 }

 // You can also get the last number of bytes REALLY put into the buffer.
 size_t really_read = in_stream.LastRead();

 // Ok, moves to the beginning of the stream. SeekI returns the last position 
 // in the stream counted from the beginning.
 off_t old_position = in_stream.SeekI(0, wxFromBeginning);
 
 // What is my current position ? off_t position = in_stream.TellI();

 // wxFileInputStream will close the file descriptor on destruction.
</PRE>
