スレッドはプログラム内の基本的な実行パスです。Threads are sometimes called <I>light-weight processes</I>, but the fundamental difference between threads and processes is that memory spaces of different processes are separated while all threads share the same address space. <P>

While it makes it much easier to share common data between several threads, it also 
makes it much easier to shoot oneself in the foot, so careful use of synchronization 
objects such as <A HREF="wx_wxmutex.html#wxmutex">mutexes</A> or <A HREF="wx_wxcriticalsection.html#wxcriticalsection">critical sections</A> is recommended. In addition, don't create global thread 
objects because they allocate memory in their constructor, which will cause 
problems for the memory checking system.<P>

<H3>Types of wxThreads</H3>
<P>

There are two types of threads in wxWidgets: <I>detached</I> and <I>joinable</I>,
modeled after the the POSIX thread API. This is different from the Win32 API
where all threads are joinable.  <P>

By default wxThreads in wxWidgets use the detached behavior. Detached threads
delete themselves once they have completed, either by themselves when they complete 
processing or through a call to <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">wxThread::Delete</A>, and thus 
must be created on the heap (through the new operator, for example). Conversely, 
joinable threads do not delete themselves when they are done processing and as such
are safe to create on the stack. Joinable threads also provide the ability
for one to get value it returned from <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadentry">wxThread::Entry</A>
through <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadwait">wxThread::Wait</A>.<P>

You shouldn't hurry to create all the threads joinable, however, because this
has a disadvantage as well: you <B>must</B> Wait() for a joinable thread or the
system resources used by it will never be freed, and you also must delete the
corresponding wxThread object yourself if you did not create it on the stack. In 
contrast, detached threads are of the "fire-and-forget" kind: you only have to start 
a detached thread and it will terminate and destroy itself.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="deletionwxthread"></A>
<H3>wxThread deletion</H3>
<P>

Regardless of whether it has terminated or not, you should call 
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadwait">wxThread::Wait</A> on a joinable thread to release its
memory, as outlined in <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#typeswxthread">Types of wxThreads</A>. If you created
a joinable thread on the heap, remember to delete it manually with the delete 
operator or similar means as only detached threads handle this type of memory 
management.<P>

Since detached threads delete themselves when they are finished processing,
you should take care when calling a routine on one. If you are certain the 
thread is still running and would like to end it, you may call 
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">wxThread::Delete</A> to gracefully end it (which implies
that the thread will be deleted after that call to Delete()). It should be
implied that you should never attempt to delete a detached thread with the 
delete operator or similar means.  <P>

As mentioned, <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadwait">wxThread::Wait</A> or 
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">wxThread::Delete</A> attempts to gracefully terminate
a joinable and detached thread, respectively. It does this by waiting until
the thread in question calls <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadtestdestroy">wxThread::TestDestroy</A>
or ends processing (returns from <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadentry">wxThread::Entry</A>).<P>

Obviously, if the thread does call TestDestroy() and does not end the calling
thread will come to halt. This is why it is important to call TestDestroy() in
the Entry() routine of your threads as often as possible.<P>

As a last resort you can end the thread immediately through 
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadkill">wxThread::Kill</A>. It is strongly recommended that you
do not do this, however, as it does not free the resources associated with
the object (although the wxThread object of detached threads will still be
deleted) and could leave the C runtime library in an undefined state.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="secondarywxthread"></A>
<H3>wxWidgets calls in secondary threads</H3>
<P>

All threads other then the "main application thread" (the one
<A HREF="wx_wxapp.html#wxapponinit">wxApp::OnInit</A> or your main function runs in, for 
example) are considered "secondary threads". These include all threads created 
by <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadcreate">wxThread::Create</A> or the corresponding constructors.<P>

GUI calls, such as those to a <A HREF="wx_wxwindow.html#wxwindow">wxWindow</A> or 
<A HREF="wx_wxbitmap.html#wxbitmap">wxBitmap</A> are explicitly not safe at all in secondary threads 
and could end your application prematurely. This is due to several reasons,
including the underlying native API and the fact that wxThread does not run a 
GUI event loop similar to other APIs as MFC.  <P>

A workaround that works on some wxWidgets ports is calling <A HREF="wx_threadfunctions.html#wxmutexguienter">wxMutexGUIEnter</A> 
before any GUI calls and then calling <A HREF="wx_threadfunctions.html#wxmutexguileave">wxMutexGUILeave</A> afterwords. However,
the recommended way is to simply process the GUI calls in the main thread 
through an event that is posted by either <A HREF="wx_miscellany.html#wxpostevent">wxPostEvent</A> or
<A HREF="wx_wxevthandler.html#wxevthandleraddpendingevent">wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent</A>. This does 
not imply that calls to these classes are thread-safe, however, as most 
wxWidgets classes are not thread-safe, including wxString.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="dontpollwxthread"></A>
<H3>Don't poll a wxThread</H3>
<P>

A common problem users experience with wxThread is that in their main thread
they will check the thread every now and then to see if it has ended through
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadisrunning">wxThread::IsRunning</A>, only to find that their 
application has run into problems because the thread is using the default
behavior and has already deleted itself. Naturally, they instead attempt to
use joinable threads in place of the previous behavior.<P>

However, polling a wxThread for when it has ended is in general a bad idea -
in fact calling a routine on any running wxThread should be avoided if 
possible. Instead, find a way to notify yourself when the thread has ended.
Usually you only need to notify the main thread, in which case you can post
an event to it via <A HREF="wx_miscellany.html#wxpostevent">wxPostEvent</A> or
<A HREF="wx_wxevthandler.html#wxevthandleraddpendingevent">wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent</A>. In 
the case of secondary threads you can call a routine of another class
when the thread is about to complete processing and/or set the value
of a variable, possibly using <A HREF="wx_wxmutex.html#wxmutex">mutexes</A> and/or other 
synchronization means if necessary.<P>

This constructor creates a new detached (default) or joinable C++ thread object. It

The destructor frees the resources associated with the thread. Notice that you
should never delete a detached thread -- you may only call
<A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">Delete</A> on it or wait until it terminates (and auto
destructs) itself. Because the detached threads delete themselves, they can
only be allocated on the heap.<P>

Joinable threads should be deleted explicitly. The <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">Delete</A> and <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadkill">Kill</A> functions
will not delete the C++ thread object. It is also safe to allocate them on

Creates a new thread. The thread object is created in the suspended state, and you
should call <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadrun">Run</A> to start running it.  You may optionally
specify the stack size to be allocated to it (Ignored on platforms that don't
support setting it explicitly, eg. Unix system without
<TT>pthread_attr_setstacksize</TT>). If you do not specify the stack size,
the system's default value is used.<P>
<B>Warning:</B> It is a good idea to explicitly specify a value as systems'
default values vary from just a couple of KB on some systems (BSD and
OS/2 systems) to one or several MB (Windows, Solaris, Linux). So, if you
have a thread that requires more than just a few KB of memory, you will
have mysterious problems on some platforms but not on the common ones. On the
other hand, just indicating a large stack size by default will give you
performance issues on those systems with small default stack since those
typically use fully committed memory for the stack. On the contrary, if
use a lot of threads (say several hundred), virtual adress space can get tight
unless you explicitly specify a smaller amount of thread stack space for each
thread.<P>

not calling it would prevent both stopping and suspending thread from working.<P>


<HR>
<A NAME="wxthreadthis"></A>
<H3>wxThread::This</H3>
<P>
<B>static <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthread">wxThread</A> *</B> </B> <B>This</B>()<P>

Return the thread object for the calling thread. NULL is returned if the calling thread
is the main (GUI) thread, but <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadismain">IsMain</A> should be used to test
whether the thread is really the main one because NULL may also be returned for the thread
not created with wxThread class. Generally speaking, the return value for such a thread
is undefined.<P>


<HR>
<A NAME="wxthreadyield"></A>
<H3>wxThread::Yield</H3>
<P>
<B>void</B> <B>Yield</B>()<P>

Give the rest of the thread time slice to the system allowing the other threads to run.
See also <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadsleep">Sleep()</A>.<P>


<HR>
<A NAME="wxthreadwait"></A>
<H3>wxThread::Wait</H3>
<P>
<B>ExitCode</B> <B>Wait</B>() <B>const</B><P>

Waits for a joinable thread to terminate and returns the value the thread
returned from <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreadentry">wxThread::Entry</A> or <TT>(ExitCode)-1</TT> on
error. Notice that, unlike <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#wxthreaddelete">Delete</A> doesn't cancel the
thread in any way so the caller waits for as long as it takes to the thread to
exit.<P>

You can only Wait() for joinable (not detached) threads.<P>

This function can only be called from another thread context.<P>

See <A HREF="wx_wxthread.html#deletionwxthread">wxThread deletion</A> for a broader explanation of this routine.<P>
